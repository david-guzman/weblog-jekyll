In the last part of the series on Server-sent events (SSE) technology, this
post will cover the implementation of a sample Angular client to consume the
messages streamed by the JAX-RS endpoint.

## Source code

The complete source code of the example used in this post is available on the
weblogâ€™s [Github repo][guzman-github], in the `jaxrs-sse/jaxrs-sse-ng` folder.

Java 8 and Apache Maven 3 are required to run the code.

## Demo application

The SSE demo application consists of a JAX-RS web resource (covered in the
[previous post][post-part2]) and an Angular client.
This sample application, uses a hospital clinic as an example, and displays
information from patients as they go through their visit from checking in at
the reception desk until they collect their prescription from the pharmacist.

The events pushed by the JAX-RS resource are organised by name (nurse, registrar, etc.).
```
event: NURSE
data: Patient 97649142

event: REGISTRAR1
data: Patient 97649142

event: NURSE
data: Patient 04703214
```
The data is displayed in a simple table (`app.component.html`), with each row
representing a consultation room. The table displays which rooms are available and
which are busy if a consultation is taking place (in which case the patient ID
will be displayed).
```html {% raw %}
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Nurse</th>
      <td>{{clinicRooms.nurse}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Registrar 1</th>
      <td>{{clinicRooms.registrar1}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Registrar 2</th>
      <td>{{clinicRooms.registrar2}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Consultant</th>
      <td>{{clinicRooms.consultant}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Radiologist</th>
      <td>{{clinicRooms.radiologist}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Phlebotomist</th>
      <td>{{clinicRooms.phlebotomist}}</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
{% endraw %} ```

The Angular component takes care of the mapping of the data obtained from
`AppService` service in the method `mapToRooms()`. The interaction with the JAX-RS
resource is delegated to `AppService`.
```typescript
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {

  clinicRooms: ClinicRooms = new ClinicRooms();

  constructor(private appService: AppService) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.getSses();
  }

  getSses() {
    const sses = this.appService.subscribeToJaxRs();

    sses.subscribe({
      next: (msg: string) => {
        this.mapToRooms(msg);
      }
    });
  }

  mapToRooms(m: string) {
    const entry = m.split(':')
      .map(e => e.trim());
    switch (entry[0]) {
      case 'NURSE':
        this.clinicRooms.nurse = entry[1];
        break;
      case 'REGISTRAR1':
        this.clinicRooms.registrar1 = entry[1];
        break;
      case 'REGISTRAR2':
        this.clinicRooms.registrar2 = entry[1];
        break;
      case 'CONSULTANT':
        this.clinicRooms.consultant = entry[1];
        break;
      case 'RADIOLOGIST':
        this.clinicRooms.radiologist = entry[1];
        break;
      case 'PHLEBOTOMIST':
        this.clinicRooms.phlebotomist = entry[1];
        break;
      default:
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

## EventSource

The [W3C specification][sse-spec] introduces the `EventSource` interface to enable web pages
to receive data pushed from a server.

[MDN][eventsource-webapi] defines EventSource as:
>The EventSource interface is used to receive server-sent events. It connects to a server over HTTP and receives events in text/event-stream format without closing the connection.

The `EventSource` interface defines 3 event handlers to interact with the server:
* *onopen* : called when the connection was just opened.
* *onerror* : called when an error occurs.
* *onmessage* : called when a message is coming from the server.

`EventSource` also defines the `readyState` attribute, which can have one of the
following 3 values:
* *CONNECTING*
* *OPEN*
* *CLOSED*

While `readyState` is set to *OPEN*, the user agent will be dispatching events,
as they arrive from the server.

The `AppService` service makes use of `EventSource` to connect to the JAX-RS
resource returning an `Observable` that is populated with data from events as
they arrive from the server (`onmessage` event handler).

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AppService {

    private url = "http://localhost:8081/jaxrs-sse-web/webresources/sse";

    subscribeToJaxRs(): Observable<string> {
        console.log('subscribing to SSE from ' + this.url);

        const eventSource = new EventSource(this.url);

        return Observable.create((observer: Observer<string>) => {

            eventSource.onopen = (x: any) => {
                console.log('connection open ' + x.timeStamp);
                console.log('readyState = ' + eventSource.readyState);
            };

            eventSource.onmessage = x => {
                observer.next(x.data);
            };

            eventSource.onerror = () => {
                console.log('ERROR - readyState = ' + eventSource.readyState);
            };

            eventSource.close = () => {
                observer.complete();
            };

        });
    }

}
```

### Browser support

EventSource API is supported in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari.

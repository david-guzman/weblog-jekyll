In the last part of the series on Server-sent events (SSE) technology, this
post will cover the implementation of a sample Angular client to consume the
messages streamed by the JAX-RS endpoint.

## Source code

The complete source code of the example used in this post is available on the
weblogâ€™s [Github repo][guzman-github], in the `jaxrs-sse/jaxrs-sse-ng` folder.

Java 8 and Apache Maven 3 are required to run the code.

## Demo application

The SSE demo application consists of a JAX-RS web resource (covered in the
[previous post][post-part2]) and an Angular client.
